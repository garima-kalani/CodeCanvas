Equilibrium point in an array is an index (or position) such that the sum of all elements before that index is same as sum of elements after it. Note: Return equilibrium point in 1-based indexing.

Inversion Count: For an array, inversion count indicates how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If the array is already sorted then the inversion count is 0.

Arrival and departure time can never be the same for a train but we can have arrival time of one train equal to departure time of the other.
